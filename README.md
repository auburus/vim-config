# My vim config file

This is a WIP file, as is my life learning vim.

You can look at it, get inspired by it (probably not), and even if
you are more bored than an eskimo in an ice skating club, you may
suggest some improvements through a pull-request.

Keep in mind that i mostly program in PHP (I know, I'm sorry, but work
is work) and python.
